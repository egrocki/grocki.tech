			<h1>
			My name is Ely Grocki and I am Junior at Assabet Vally Regional
			Technical High School. I am in the Computer Programming and Web Developmet 
			program and I love to work with computers.</br></br>
			
			I work at Best Buy in Marlborough as a sales consultant. I decided to
			get a job at best buy becasue I think that it is great experiance for 
			not only a lot of new technology but also it shows the world of retail.
			If you would like to take a look at my resume, I have it up to view under
			the Ruseme tab.</br></br>
			
			One of my goals for the future is to learn more about entrepreneurship. I
			have alwaysed been interested in owning my own electronics company. Ever
			since i was little i have loved building and taking apart anything that 
			is electronic.</br></br>

			Over the past two years i have learned alot about programming
			due to my shop at school which i find to be a great skill to have especially 
			if i want to coninue working on computers. If you would like to check out
			some of the programs that i have built over the last few years, you can find 
			examples over on the Artifacts page.
